# Wisp_Puzzle
Puzzle prototype unity project called Wisp.

Currently two unity projects for this prototype, will focus on the orgiginal recreated one w/o AI. 

Plan to implement
- colour sensing of the grid and pieces
-  black/white colour change depending on colour of pieces and grid
-  randomisation of grid and pieces
-  variations for movement, one block, two block, slide.
-  fix movement bug, where sometimes pieces glitch out of the map or into different location. potentially to do with enemy movement options.
